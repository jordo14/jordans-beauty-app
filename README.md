# jordans-beauty-app

## Overview
My Web Application is going to be a Beauty App that allows a user to look up a product that shows them if it fits their health concerns. This includes information like whether a product is gluten-free, non-gmo, or natural, etc... This idea came from how me and most of the women in my family have a gluten intolerance so we always have to make sure certain products/food cater to our health.
